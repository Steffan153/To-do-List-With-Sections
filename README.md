# To-do List With Sections

A to do list with PHP, cookies, and you can even make sections!

To start, make sure you are running this on localhost or the server you are putting it on and make sure PHP can run on your serve, because this is mostly PHP.

Next, to go to the home page of the to-do-list, just go to http://localhost/to-do-list-with-sections/ or whatever the place you put the stuff to.  Now, you have a nice to-do-list!

**Note:**  Cookies must be enabled for this to work.
Also, for several things to work, you must have JavaScript enabled.
