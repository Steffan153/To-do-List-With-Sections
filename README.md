# To-do List With Sections

A to do list with PHP, cookies, and you can even make sections!

To start, make sure you are running this on localhost or the server you are putting it on, because this is mostly PHP.
Next, to go to the home, just go to http://localhost/to-do-list-with-sections/ or whatever the place you put the stuff to.
Now, you can create tasks, sections, and you can even add prioritys!

**Note:**  Cookies must be enabled for this to work.
Also, for several things to work, you must have JavaScript enabled.
